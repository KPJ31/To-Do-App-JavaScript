# To-Do-App-JavaScript
This ToDo App is a minimalist task management web app created using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks based on their status (All, Pending, Completed). The app stores tasks in the browser’s localStorage so users don’t lose their tasks upon refresh or closing the browser.
